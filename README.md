# dns-firewall

to run:
```bash
cd dns-firewall
sudo python3 simulator/attack.py
```

The requirements.txt file lists all the modules that need to be installed. Since we are using scapy, which requires root privileges, the script must be run using sudo.
We do not require a virtual environment file for this project.
